Librera Reader is a highly customizable and feature-rich application
for reading e-books in PDF, EPUB, MOBI, DjVu, FB2, TXT, RTF, AZW, AZW3, HTML, CBZ, CBR, DOC, DOCX, etc. formats

With its intuitive, yet powerful, interface, Librera makes ebook reading a veritable pleasure. 
It even features a unique auto-scrolling, hands-free Musician's mode, with contollable speed

For better security, the F-Droid version, is based on the latest MuPDF 1.16.1 and does not require access to the Internet.

For the above reason, some Internet-related features of Librera Reader are missing in its F-Droid version:
1) Access to OPDS (Calibre) Catalogs
2) Google Drive Syncing
3) Access to Clouds (Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive)
4) Saving (sharing) pages from web browsers
5) Rendering MathML formulas in epub3 books
6) Access to the What's New page
