# Adding and Handling Custom Tags

> By adding custom tags to the books in our Library we are adding some meaningful (for us) information to the books' metadata. These tags will come in handy in our future references to the books we have assigned tags to. They will help us organize books in the Library, sort them to our liking, create user-specific booklists, easily find books in the Library, etc.
> User-defined tags will be used for all imaginable purposes alongside already existing conventional e-book tags, such as [Series](), [Authors](), [Keywords](), [Genres](), etc.

> There are many ways to add a **New tag** to a book.

* By long-pressing the star (Favorites) icon
* By calling the book menu and tapping _Add tags_
* Via the _File info_ window (Tip: a long-press on a book cover will get you there)

## Adding and deleting tags (as easy as a pie)

* Tap on _New tag_
* Add meaningful information here
* To delete a tag, tap an _x_ next to it and then confirm deletion
> The deleted tag will be removed from all the books it is assigned to.
