## Adjusting Page Layout in PDF/DjVu

Page "rigidity" in PDF/DjVu and the size of your screen will dictate your page layout choices:
* _Single Page_ or _Two Pages_ mode for _Portrait_ orientation on large screens
* _Two Pages_ mode, preferred for large screens and _Landscape_ orientation
* Sometimes the cover page must be presented separately, especially if illustrations in your book run across spreads (choose _Cover, Two Pages_ in this case)
