# Using Dictionaries and Translators

> When you read a book, especially in a foreign language, you may need to look up the meaning of a word you don't know in a dictionary. With **Librera**, you can do it easily, in a single click, on- and offline.

**Librera** allows you to look up a single word or translate entire passages using online translators (dictionaries).

There are plenty of **ONLINE** dictionaries and translators on the Internet. They allow you to check the meaning of a word without installing anything on your device.
> **Librera** will open a browser window for you with the selected word in the search field of the chosen dictionary.
 
 You can choose from the following (to name just a few):

* Lingvo
* Oxford
* Longman
* Cambridge
* Macmillan
* Collins
* Merriam-Webster
* 1tudien
* Vdict
* Wikipedia
* Wiktionary
* Academic.ru
* Vocabulary.com
* Deepl.com
* Treccani.it, etc.

**OFFLINE** dictionaries and translators need to be installed on your device from Google Play (or elsewhere). They will pop up a window with the translation or definition of a selected word, and don't rely on the Internet to work.

1. A list of most popular free dictionaries and translators on Google play is as follows:
* Google Translate
* Microsoft Translator
* Multitran Russian Dictionary
* Oxford Dictionary
* Yandex.Translate, etc.
2. You can also install a **dictionary-shell**, which will handle dictionaries made by third-party compilers, as, for instance:
* GoldenDict
* Fora Dictionary, etc.
 
> **If you have not found in *Librera* the online resource you're looking for, please send your request to the developers at librera.reader@gmail.com or raise an issue on github.**
