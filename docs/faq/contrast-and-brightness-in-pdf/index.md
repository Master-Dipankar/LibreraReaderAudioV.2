# Contrast and Brightness in PDF  (Black/White Effect)

> PDF readability in **Librera Reader** can be improved significantly by manual adjustments to brightness and contrast settings. When you switch to manual mode, your document will be displayed in black-and-white and you will see the results of your adjustments in real time in the background, behind the **Contrast and Brightness** window.
> The adjustments mimic the effect often used in E-Ink readers.

You can adjust the following settings:
* Contrast
* Brightness 
* Or/and you can apply the automatic _Emphasize all_ setting (a bold-letter effect)

> All three settings can be applied separately or you can use all three combined.

## Contrast
* Tap on the _Contrast/Brightness_ icon in the center-tap-menu
* Check the _Adjust manually_ box in the **Contrast and Brightness** window and use the _Contrast_ slider (or **-** and **+**) to adjust the setting.
* Tap outside the window (or on the _x_ in its upper right corner) to close it.
