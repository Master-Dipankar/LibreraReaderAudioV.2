# How to Select Text in _Librera_

> **Librera**'s text selection options are quite sophisticated. With a long press (and dragging), you can select words, passages, and entire pages. Then you can easily, in a single tap, copy text to paste it in another app, share your selection with other users, make a bookmark, send it to a TTS engine (to read it out loud) or to on-/off-line translators/dictionaries, etc.

To enable text selection:
* Tap at center-screen to open the menu
* Tap the settings icon to open the **Preferences** window
* Go to the _Advanced Settings_ tab and check the respective box

## Text Selection Options
* Impatient users can check the _Single-tap to select_ box. (This option works great with the _Open selection in dictionary_ option in the main tab of the **Preferences** window)
* The _Select text letter by letter_ option should come in handy when selecting text in some Asian languages

## Selecting Text Segments and Entire Pages
* Long-press on a word in the passage you intend to select
* Drag your finger in the selection direction. When you see the start and end handles, you can release your finger, close the _Text_ window and continue selecting text by dragging the handles
* To select an entire page, open the _Go to Page_ window by tapping the thumbnail view icon
* Long-press on the page you intend to select and choose an option from the dropdown list
