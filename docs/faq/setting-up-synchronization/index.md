# Syncing Your Reading Setup Across Multiple Devices


> **Librera** is equipped with a syncing tool that should come in handy in cases when users own more than one Android device and tend to alternate between them (even sporadically). Using this tool, you will be able to sync **Librera**'s profiles, reading progress, bookmarks, and your reading settings.

For the convenience of most of our users, we have chosen Google Drive as **Librera**'s synchronization hub.

* To enable syncing, go to the _Sync_ panel in the slide-out _Preferences_ tab and check the respective box
* You need to sign into your Google Drive account
 
> **To ensure proper synchronization, your other devices must be logged into the same account.**

## Synchronization Options

* If _Manual sync_ is checked, you will need to swipe your finger down the screen to start syncing (in Android's native pull-to-refresh fashion)
* You can prevent the syncing tool from biting into your data plan by enabling WiFi-syncing only.
* You can entertain yourself with sync-progress animation (spinning wheel), by checking this option
* To view the sync log, just tap the settings (wheel) icon in the _Sync_ panel

> Note: Google Drive has been chosen for its convenience. Google accounts are free and available to anyone. If, for whatever reason, you prefer any other cloud solution, go ahead and use it:

> **You just need to sync the _Librera_ folder (which is in your internal storage) with your cloud. Voil√†!**

**P.S.** As for the books downloaded from online resources, you can store them in folders synced via a third-party app and add those folders to **Librera**'s Library.
