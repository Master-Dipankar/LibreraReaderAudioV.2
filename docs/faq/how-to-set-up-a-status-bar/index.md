# Setting Up the Status Bar

> You can configure **Librera**'s status bar to display tons of useful information on your reading screen... or you can remove it altogether, as an annoying distraction.

You can make all changes to the status bar in the _Status Bar_ tab:
* Tap at center-screen to call the main menu
* Tap on the settings icon 
* Open the _Status Bar_ tab

By default, the status bar is located at the screen bottom. Use the _Position_ dropdown list to change its location.
> Note! If the _Top_ setting is selected, the _Always display book title on top_ will gray out.
* The _Show status bar_ box must be checked, if you want any information be displayed while you're reading a book
