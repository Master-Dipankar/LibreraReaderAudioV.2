# Working with Bookmarks in Extended Mode (Bookmarks Ribbon)

> You can make **Librera** display your bookmarks on screen at all times while reading a book. They will be shown across the top of the screen in a so-called _Bookmarks Ribbon_. This extended bookmark mode should come in handy when you need to add new bookmarks or switch between them in an instant. 
> We expect this cool feature be in high demand with musicians, while running the app in _Musician's_ mode. So, it comes with the Ribbon enabled in this mode by default.

To enable it in the other modes:

* Tap the _Settings_ icon to open the **Preferences** window
* Tap on the _Status Bar_ tab
* In the _Bookmarks Ribbon_ panel, check the box next to the mode you intend to enable the Ribbon for.

Operations with the _Bookmarks Ribbon_ are illustrated in _Book_ mode. It all works the same for all three modes.

> If you no longer need the _Bookmark Ribbon_, you can disable it by unchecking the respective box in the _Status bar_ tab.

**Adding Bookmarks**

> The bookmark floater in the upper right corner indicates that you're currently in _Bookmarks Ribbon_ mode.

* Tap the bookmark floater on the page you are about to bookmark
* Tap _ADD_ to actually add the bookmark via the _Bookmarks_ window
* Make a comment to the bookmark. Note that the bookmark's name comes from your comment (**first bookmark** in our example).
* Tap **ADD** to complete the procedure.

Your new bookmark will appear in the _Bookmarks_ window, and at the same time you will see it in the _Bookmarks Ribbon_ on top. Now, in order to go back to this bookmark, you just need to tap on it in the Ribbon.

> Note: A long-press on a bookmark in the Ribbon will open an edit window.
* Save your editing results by tapping **SAVE**
* Or you can delete the bookmark by tapping **DELETE**
The Ribbon will become a full-blown ribbon across your screen when you have many bookmarks. You can navigate through them by finger swipes.

* A long-press on a bookmark in the _Bookmarks Ribbon_ will open a prompt suggesting you to delete it.
