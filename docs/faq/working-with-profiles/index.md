# Working with _Librera_'s Profiles

> **Librera** allows you to create multiple profiles. You can add one for anything, from day/night reading to your mood swings to book genres to your special attitude to a certain writer, etc. 
> And remember: Another profile (that might cheer you up) is just a couple of taps away (from your current one).


## Adding a New Profile
* Go to the slide-out **Preferences** tab and tap the settings icon in the _Profile_ panel (at the very top)
* Tap on the _New Profile_ link in the profile list window
* Specify a meaningful name for the new profile and _ADD_ it to the list
* Now you can configure the UI and reading settings for your new profile
