* Enable single-touch (long-press) dictionary lookup (check the box)
* This also holds for passage translations if your "dictionary-of-choice" is, say, Google Translate (make sure your Internet connection is up and running)
> Note! You can configure **Librera** to select words on a single tap in the _Advanced Settings_ tab (not recommended)

If the _Open selection in dictionary_ is unchecked, you will be presented with multiple choices in the _Text_ window:
* Make **Librera** pronounce the word for you or read your selection back to you out loud
* Make it read the entire book out loud (voice-accompanied reading)
* Open the word/passage in another dictionary/translator
* Bookmark pages with meaningful word sequences
