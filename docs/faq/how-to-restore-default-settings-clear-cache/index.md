# How to Restore Default Settings/Clear Cache

> **Librera** is a very flexible app which allows you to tinker with and fine-tune lots of its settings, theming its UI and reading conditions. Obviously, it might happen that you won't like some results of your experiments with **Librera**'s setting. No worries! There is always a way to revert the app easily and quickly to its original state. In many aspects it's similar to clearing cache (and sometimes it's exactly what it is).

## Reseting a Profile

> Sometimes it's easier to discard unwanted changes on the profile level, by reverting your current profile to its pristine state (the moment of creation). Just follow these easy steps:
 * Long-press on your current profile name in the _Profile_ panel of the slide-out **Preferences** tab
 * Confirm your intention in a popup dialog by tapping _OK_

**Note: Your bookmarks, tags, and reading progresses won't be deleted or reset!**

* Just tap on the _Restore default_ link nearby, and start anew

## Renaming Reading Modes and Clearing Changes

> In its endless flexibility, **Librera** gives you the option to change the names of reading modes. It also allows you to restore them in just one easy step.
* Tap the settings icon next to _Remember reading mode_ in the slide-out **Preferences** tab
* Tap _Edit_ in the **Reading Mode** window to make the names editable
* Rename the modes and tap _Save_
* To discard changes and revert to default names, long-press _Edit_

> **If, for whatever reason, you're stuck with something that won't work properly, and need a "clean slate," you can uninstall _Librera Reader_ from the system and manually delete the _Librera_ folder from the internal storage on your device.**
