# Setting Up Fingerprint or Password Protection

> In **Librera**, you can protect your most sensitive documents from being viewed by unauthorized users who may accidentally or otherwise acquire access to your device. As a matter of fact, you will protect ALL your documents since you are restricting access to the app itself.
The documents can be either fingerprint- or password-protected.

## Enabling Startup Authorization

* Close the book you're currently reading
*Tap on the **Preferences** tab and scroll down to the _General Settings_ panel
* Check the _Prompt for password_ box
> If you **Preferences** window is animated, you will call it by tapping the hamburger icon in the upper left corner or a right swipe from the left edge of the screen.
