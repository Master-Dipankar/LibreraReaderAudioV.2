# Customizing Page Background

> **Librera** allows the user to read their books against a customizable background. The user can have a specific background for each profile, configurable separately for day and night reading modes. Backgrounds can be just solid colors or the user can add textures (or pictures) to them, either from **Librera**'s sample files or using their own images.

## Setting Up Your Own Background
* Tap the settings icon to open the **Preferences** window
* Tap _Day_ for changing the background for day mode (or _Night_ for night mode)
* In the _Background_ panel, you will be able to change your backgound color and texture (or you can just hang up your own picture in the background)
* Your background picture's transparency can be changed by dragging the _Transparency_ slider
