# Creating a New TXT File for Notes, Quotes, etc.

> You can use **Librera**'s notepad functionality to create your own files in .txt format. It will come in handy when you decide to make a compilation of quotations from the books you're reading (by copying/pasting), jot down your notes on a book, compile a file for audio (TTS) recording, etc. 

To create a new file:
* Tap on the _New File_ link in the slide-out Preferences tab (menu)
* Enter a meaningful name for your file, ending in ".txt"
* Type or paste the content of this new TXT file and tap _SAVE_
> **The new file will be saved to the _Downloads_ folder on your device (internal storage).**
