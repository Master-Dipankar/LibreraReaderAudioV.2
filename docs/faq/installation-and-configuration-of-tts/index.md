# Using a Text-to-Speech Engine with _Librera_ 

> **Librera** can read your books (and other documents) out loud using a third-party Text-to-Speech (TTS) engine installed on your Android system. It supports read-aloud for a great number of ebook formats, from EPUB to Kindle to PDF.

# Choosing a TTS Engine

* Tap on the TTS icon at the bottom of the screen to open the **TTS Settings** window
* Tap **"i"** to open a dropdown list of TTS engines
* Select whatever engine you like. If the engine you've chosen is not installed yet on your system, you'll be redirected to Google Play Store. Follow the instructions for your preferred engine in order to set it up, download main and additional voices, etc.

> Note: You may be charged for extra features, e.g., additional voices, by the engine's developers.

* Test the voice you've selected by tapping _PLAY_ back on the **Text-to-speech output** page

> Note: Voice setup in other TTS engines is conducted in a similar fashion. Remember that voice data files could be quite large. To spare your limited cellular data plans, make sure they are downloaded via WiFi connection only.
