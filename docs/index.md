With __Librera Reader__, you can easily create self-maintained libraries of all your documents by specifying which formats to include and which folders to scan. All document collections can be viewed as a list or grid. Documents are easily identified by size- and style-adjustable thumbnail covers and detailed descriptions. Your library can be sorted by path, name, size, date, etc., and there is a filter to help locate specific documents or document groups.

While reading, documents can be locked into a vertical-scroll-only mode and navigated either page- or screen-wise. Text can be reflowed and annotated. Volume keys' functionality is configurable, and backgrounds and fonts customizable via the intuitive Settings window. Excerpts (selections) can be translated, shared, copied, and searched for inside the document or on the Internet.

The best way to fully appreciate Librera Reader, however, is to use its PRO version. You can start with Free, ad-supported one first, and decide for yourselves. We promise you won't be disappointed. Once you are convinced, please obtain a PRO license to help the app's further development.
