# Syncing via Google Drive

Syncing is intended to be used on multiple Android devices connected to Google Drive. While reading a book, you will be able to pick up on your tablet at night right where you've left off on your phone during the day. Syncing is supported by **all** apps of the Librera family. And it's FREE.

You can sync the following parameters:

* Reading Progress for all the books you're currently reading (either synced or not). Keep the filenames the same across all your devices, and your books will be synced automatically
* Bookmarks
* Recent list
* Favorites and tags

Examples of Syncing

* Enable Syncing via Google Drive (need to have your Google credentials handy)
* To sync a book, invoke its menu and choose _Sync_
* All your books in the Favorites tab will be synced

# Profiles

Using profiles is like having multiple instances of Librera installed on your device, each with its separate settings, booklists, reading progresses, and bookmarks. You are allowed to create new profiles and delete old ones. All apps of the Librera family have this feature.

Profiles are stored in the device's internal  memory  at /sdcard/Librera/profile.[NAME]. Their settings, bookmarks, reading progresses are stored in JSON files, which may be viewed w/ any JSON-viewer (refrain from modifying them, though!).

A **long press** on a profile name will pop up an alert window for you to restore its default (initial) settings (your bookmarks and reading progresses will remain intact).
